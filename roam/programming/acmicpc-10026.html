A little known fact about cows is the fact that they are red-green colorblind, meaning that red and green look identical to them.  This makes it especially difficult to design artwork that is appealing to cows as well as humans.
</p>

<p>
Consider a square painting that is described by an N x N grid of characters (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100), each one either R (red), G (green), or B (blue).  A painting is interesting if it has many colored "regions" that can be distinguished from each-other.  Two characters belong to the same region if they are directly adjacent (east, west, north, or south), and if they are indistinguishable in color.  For example, the painting
</p>

<p>
RRRBB
GGBBB
BBBRR
BBRRR
RRRRR
</p>

<p>
has 4 regions (2 red, 1 blue, and 1 green) if viewed by a human, but only 3regions (2 red-green, 1 blue) if viewed by a cow.  
</p>

<p>
Given a painting as input, please help compute the number of regions in the painting when viewed by a human and by a cow.

A standard <a href="../main/breadth_first_search.html#ID-8acb2539-670e-4986-b6e8-38102dff761f">Breadth First Search</a> problem, but I believe that I became more adept at its application. In this problem I used string argument to differentiate logic.
