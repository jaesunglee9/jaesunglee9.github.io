<h1 class="title">Spiking Neural Network</h1>
</header><p>
Spiking neural network(SNN)s are a type of neural networks that utilize spikes for computation.
In fact, deep neural network(DNN)s can be considered to be a subset of SNNs, since they are functionally
equivalent to rate based SNN, where the activation value of a neuron is the firing rate. However,
when we speak of SNNs, we typically exclude DNNs. The reason for researching SNN is as follows:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The brain utilizes different spike encoding schemas from rate based coding.</li>
<li>encoding information in time can allow efficient and natural encoding.</li>
<li>encoding information in time allows diverse computations.</li>
</ol>

<p>
What are important computations that will be required for SNNs?
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Delays
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Axonal delays and Dendritic delays do exist in the brain. Since there are mechanisms in the brain to either
shorten or lengthen delays, they are assumed to be helpful. However, It remains to be studied whether the
two delays can be represented using one variable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Local learning
-STDP is used frequently, but recently, the recent research shows that dendritic bursts from apical synapses
 cause different behaviors. Some dub this a burst dependent synaptic plasticity. Relation with BTSP should be
 considered.</li>
</ol>
